1. Create a robot program that, in the end, can successfully complete its task.  
  Through all this learning and work in the past 3 projects, none of the project have worked great at the end. It is getting frustrated to never have a working project, which is why my first goal is to have code at the end at actually works on the robot that actually completes the task. This will be achieved by creating a simple MVP, and checking in on it frequently to make sure it is still achievable. We will also need to be very conscious of when the right time to get help is so that we are not struggling for days on something that we could get help with.  
  
2. Learn how to communicate the right amount of information between two robots so they can complete the task at hand.  
  This project, our stretch end goal is to have two robots in a maze be able to find each other using maps they create. THis will require eventual information passing between robots, but we wonâ€™t need to pass all the information one robot has to the other. I think that it is important in multi-robot systems to know what information needs to be passed so that time and computing power is not wasted. We are not spending too much time on the communication method, but we will be determining what information to pass, so I am hoping to do this part properly instead of passing over all the information one robot has.  
  
3. Understand all of the code, not just to explain it, but to be able to write it again myself.  
  I think that the past few projects there was code I didn't understand/could explain what it did at a high level but wouldn't be able to repeat it. This was mainly because of our team code writing technique, and is not necessarily bad in a team. However, I want to learn the most I can, so I plan to really understand the code this project by having my team include a lot of comments, and having us talk about things we work on alone until everyone understands what was written.
